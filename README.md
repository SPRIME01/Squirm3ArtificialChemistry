Squirm3 is an artificial chemistry simulation - a world where we can make up our own rules of construction and let them rip.

In the screenshot above, each block represents an atom.  When two atoms collide then a reaction might occur.  If the reaction is a one of the available strong reactions then a bond will form.  Lines are drawn between atoms with bonds.  A cluster of atoms with strong bonds represent a molecule.

DNA and RNA are types of macromolecules.  They aren't represented in the demo but consider that DNA and RNA molecules have interesting behavior.
